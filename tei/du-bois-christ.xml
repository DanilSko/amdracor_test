     There sits an awful silence
    </l>
    <l>
     On the Sea, and o'er the mighty mountains
    </l>
    <l>
     The hushed air doth creep with weak
    </l>
    <l>
     And trembling footsteps.
    </l>
    <l>
     The rivers smell of blood
    </l>
    <l>
     And yonder carrion condor
    </l>
    <l>
     Drunk on human hearts
    </l>
    <l>
     Shrieks and wheels up and homeward
    </l>
    <l>
     To his babes. O fated land!
    </l>
    <l>
     O vale of Death, O Mother of red murder
    </l>
    <l>
     And of war — hark!
    </l>
    <l>
     What roars from out the glen
    </l>
    <l>
     With human accents? My God they come.
    </l>
    <l>
     The blasphemy of cursing
    </l>
    <l>
     Cuts the air.
    </l>
    <l>
     The muttered mouthings
    </l>
    <l>
     Of their barrelled thunder knells
    </l>
    <l>
     From out the dells and echoes and re-echeos
    </l>
    <l>
     On the vast
    </l>
    <l>
     Andean shoulders of the hills.
    </l>
    <l>
     They come, ye gods, they come!
    </l>
    <l>
     As sweeps the throttled
    </l>
    <l>
     Bursting anger in the Devil's breast;
    </l>
    <l>
     As whirls the maddened
    </l>
    <l>
     Torrent of the Spring
    </l>
    <l>
     Around that silvery gleaming central core,
    </l>
    <l>
     Dark, terrible; the soldiering of my great father's
                                        realm

     Fond Heaven! How they reel their death cries
    </l>
    <l>
     Shake the cliffs and send the eagles
    </l>
    <l>
     Screaming to the air.
    </l>
    <l>
     Accursed be the sight — I will not see —
    </l>
    <l>
     And yet I must,

    <l>
     Since country, life and hope itself
    </l>
    <l>
     Hang in the awful scale.
    </l>
    <l>
     How hateful, harsh, and hideous
    </l>
    <l>
     Gleam the bloodless masks
    </l>
    <l>
     On that inhuman host.

     Yet how lithe and strong he looks

     How wicked wilful.
    </l>
    <l>
     He comes! Francesco!
    </l>
    <l>
     His spear points towards my heart;
    </l>
    <l>
     His eyes do glisten as the serpent's
    </l>
    <l>
     Horrid gaze!

     Thinkest thou thus to escape Saaveedra's mighty
                                        sword?
    </l>
    <l>
     Unhand me! Off with thy cold wet hands!
    </l>
    <l>
     Knave, base-born, unknightly, caitiff!
    </l>
    <l>
     Unhand me I say,
    </l>
    <l>
     Or by the great King I'll run thee through!
    </l>
    <l>
     I'll —
    </l>
    <l>
     What! callest thou Witchery to darken all the
                                        World
    </l>
    <l>
     In this bright morning hour?
    </l>
    <l>
     Thy magic all be damned;
    </l>
    <l>
     I'll grope thee out thro' blackness ten times
                                        blacker than the blackest hell!
    </l>
    <l>
     Take that — and that — and that;
    </l>
    <l>
     I warned thee fair.
    </l>
    <l>
     What Ho! Ximene!
    </l>
    <l>
     Death is dead
    </l>
    <l>
     We'll live forever!
